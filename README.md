# Haskell Code for the book "Data Science from Scratch, 2nd ed."

Work in progress.

[Data Science from Scratch, 2nd ed.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/) is a great book written by Joel Grus. The book descibes and shows implementation of data science algorithms from the first principles, not relying on existing libraries, which is very useful to understand how these algorithms really work. The code in the book is in Python, though. 

Python is without doubt is the most used programming language for data science. However, Python lacks proper functional constructs to represent the ideas without boilerplate (the proof of it is a topic for another article). This repository is an attempt to realize what data science algorithms look like in a pure functional programming language.
